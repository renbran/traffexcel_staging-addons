    'summary': 'Shared reporting engine for the ERP Heritage Odoo 19 Community accounting suite, providing a reproducible report-execution audit log and a move-version result cache. Append-only audit log of every report render with user, timestamp, the full options snapshot, runtime, and a SHA-256 result hash for XLSX and PDF output, plus a multi-company analytic-aware parameterised SQL builder with no raw user input in SQL, a three-tier User/Manager/read-only Auditor privilege model, and a currency-aware XLSX writer. Odoo 19 Community accounting reporting engine, reproducible financial report audit trail, move-version report cache invalidation, multi-company parameterised SQL builder, append-only audit log, read-only auditor role, SHA-256 report hash compliance, currency-aware XLSX export, analytic-aware journal item aggregation.',
    'description': """The shared engine that powers the ERP Heritage accounting modules for Odoo 19 Community. It auto-installs as a dependency of any ERP Heritage accounting module, so you do not need to install it by hand.

What this module gives you directly

Reproducible report audit log. Every report render is recorded as an eh.account.report.execution row: who ran it, when, with the full options snapshot, how long it took, and a SHA-256 hash of the result (for XLSX and PDF output). Re-running a report from its stored options snapshot against an unchanged ledger returns the same cached payload, so the figures reproduce exactly. The log is append-only.

Precise cache invalidation. A per-company move-version counter is incremented atomically on every account.move state change (post, set-to-draft, cancel) using a direct SQL UPDATE that adds one to the column, so there is no read-modify-write race under concurrency. Cache lookups carry the counter, so a cache hit means no state change has occurred since the cached payload was generated, and the result is recomputed the moment the underlying ledger changes.

Parameterised SQL builder. A multi-company, analytic-aware query composer that the report handlers use on the hot path. Every value binds as a query parameter, identifiers come from a fixed whitelist, no user input is interpolated into raw SQL, and every query is company-scoped so there is no cross-company leakage. It is plain Python and unit-testable without the Odoo registry.

Three-tier privilege model. User, Manager, and a read-only Auditor role, decoupled from the standard Odoo accounting groups, so an auditor can read the execution log and reports without any write access.

What other ERP Heritage modules build on top

Dynamic Reports Pro: custom report builder, scheduled email delivery, multi-period forecasting, budget variance. Bank Reconciliation Pro, Collections Workbench, Period Close Workflow, Multi-Version Budget Pro, Recurring Invoices Pro, Post-Dated Cheques, FX Period-End Revaluation, IFRS 16 Lease and Fixed Assets, Vendor Bill Automation.

Engineering principles

No silent fallbacks. Missing config, missing accounts, and malformed input each surface explicit messages naming the bad field. Failed renders are recorded too: on exception the execution row is marked error with the message and the exception is re-raised. Multi-company aware throughout. Plain Python tools (SQL builder, payload codec, XLSX writer) are unit-tested without the ORM, which keeps the hot path predictable.""",
